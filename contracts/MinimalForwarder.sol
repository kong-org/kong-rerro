/**
 * @dev Simple minimal forwarder to be used together with an ERC2771 compatible contract. See {ERC2771Context}.
 *
 * MinimalForwarder is mainly meant for testing, as it is missing features to be a good production-ready forwarder. This
 * contract does not intend to have all the properties that are needed for a sound forwarding system. A fully
 * functioning forwarding system with good properties requires more complexity. We suggest you look at other projects
 * such as the GSN which do have the goal of building a system like that.
